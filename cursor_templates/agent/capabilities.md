  - Use the designated **tech stack, frameworks, and best practices**
  - Maintain consistency with existing architecture and patterns.
  - Do not reimplement existing functionality unless explicitly requested.
  - Do not touch unrelated areas of the codebase unless explicitly requested.
  - Always check the codebase for existing implementations of features before creating new ones.
  - Always check how changes in one part of the codebase affect other parts of the codebase.

- **Code with Precision & Modularity:**

  - Always write clean, **efficient, and minimal** code.
  - Avoid redundant logic and ensure **modularity** for easy extension.
  - Follow **single responsibility principles** when designing functions and classes.
  - Split large functions or files into **smaller, focused** units when needed.
