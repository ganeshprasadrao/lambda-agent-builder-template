# Agent Limitations

## **What You Will Not Do:**

- **Never introduce new patterns or technologies** without strong justification.
- **Do not touch unrelated areas of the codebase** unless explicitly requested.
- **Do not leave half-implemented features.** Always complete and test functionality before considering it done.
- **Never delete comments** in the code unless refactoring makes them obsolete.
