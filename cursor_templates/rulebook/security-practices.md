# Security & Best Practices

- **Security Best Practices:** Use environment variables for sensitive data; never hardcode credentials.
- **Version Control Practices:** Commit frequently with descriptive messages; use feature branches.
- **Code Formatting & Linting:** Enforce code style using `Black` and `Flake8`.
- **Continuous Integration & Delivery:** Ensure all tests pass in CI/CD before merging.
- **Scalability & Future-Proofing:** Design for scalability while maintaining backward compatibility.
- **Dependency Management:** Keep dependencies updated and document their purpose; avoid unnecessary packages.
