# Testing Workflow

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Process

1. **Write tests first:**
   - Ensure tests cover success and failure cases.
   - Test agent tools independently before integrating them.
2. **Run tests frequently:**
   ```sh
   python -m pytest
   ```
   - Use `-k "test_name"` to run specific tests.
3. **Manual testing:**
   - Run API locally, test scripts, and inspect logs.

## Test Monitoring

1. **Log Analysis:**
   - Check agent initialization and tool execution logs.
   - Identify patterns in errors for systemic issues.
2. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Analyze API response times and optimize bottlenecks.
