# Coding Workflow Preferences

- **Focus on Relevant Code:** Modify only areas directly related to the task.
- **Isolate Changes:** Do not touch unrelated parts of the codebase.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure functionality is well-tested before finalizing changes.
- **Minimize Architectural Disruptions:** Avoid major refactors unless explicitly required.
- **Consider the Impact:** Evaluate how changes affect other parts of the system.
- **Commit with Clarity:** Keep commits concise, clear, and well-scoped.
- **Document Assumptions:** Note any assumptions or potential side effects.
- **Preserve Established Patterns:** Stick to existing best practices unless justified.
- **Avoid Overengineering:** Prioritize maintainability over unnecessary complexity.
- **Working With Plan**: Always work according to the plan and don't deviate, if you have ideas then we can discuss. After making any significant changes, progress, or faced with issues, made assumptions, in the codebase, then update the plan.md document accordingly to be always in sync
