# Documentation & Testing

- **Working With Plan**: Always work according to the plan and don't deviate, if you have ideas then we can discuss. After making any significant changes, progress, or faced with issues, made assumptions, in the codebase, then update the plan.md document accordingly to be always in sync
- **Documentation & Comments:** Provide meaningful docstrings and comments, especially for complex logic.
- **Unit Testing:** Write comprehensive tests using `pytest`, ensuring all tests are CI-integrated.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement robust error handling and structured logging.
- **Modular Design & Separation of Concerns:** Keep code modular, refactor common logic into reusable components.
- **Type Annotations:** Use type hints to improve code clarity and enable static checking.
- **Performance & Optimization:** Optimize code only when necessary; premature optimization is discouraged.
